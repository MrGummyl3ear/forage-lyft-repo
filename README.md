# Lyft Rental Fleet Service Component

## Introduction
Hello! I'm excited to share the work I've done on the Lyft Rental Fleet Service Component. This project is all about ensuring that cars in Lyft's new rental fleet are serviced when they are returned. It's a vital part of the logistics system, and I'm happy to have contributed to its development.

## Getting Started
Here's how you can get started with this project:

```

2.Install Dependencies: Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.Refactor Codebase: As per the project requirements, I've refactored the codebase to reflect the new design. I replaced the existing classes with new ones to meet the project's goals.

4.Implement New Classes: I implemented the new classes to handle the logic for determining whether cars should be serviced when they are returned. This involved creating classes and methods that represent the desired functionality.

5.Write Unit Tests: Testing is a crucial part of this project. I wrote unit tests for Battery and Engine classes to ensure the refactor was successful and that the code behaves as expected. This helps ensure the reliability of the service component.
